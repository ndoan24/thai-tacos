    Mint Brown is a native of Thailand, who immigrated to the United States with her family in 2015.  She has been cooking since she was a young girl and brings with her a wealth of knowledge about traditional Thai cuisine.  Originally from the northeastern region of Isaan, the key ingredient of Mint's Thai Tacos is a spicy, minced meat dish called 'Larb', available in both beef and chicken varieties.  Mint's fusion concept of this tasty Thai dish with Mexican street tacos brings together the best of both worlds!

    Thai Tacos by Mint can be found at the Pearl Street Farmer's Market from May through November.  More information about the market can be found here: https://www.southpearlstreet.com/farmers-market/
